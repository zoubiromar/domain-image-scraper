# Testing Report - Domain Image Scraper

## ✅ All Issues Fixed

### 1. **Scraping Loop Issue** - FIXED ✓
**Problem:** Results were not returning (404 error)
**Solution:** 
- Created a shared `ResultsStore` singleton class

- Added proper logging to track stored and retrieved results
**Status:** Working perfectly - results are now properly stored and retrieved

**Status:** All input methods tested and working

### 3. **Footer Update** - FIXED ✓
**Problem:** Showed 2024 and no author link
**Solution:** 
- Updated to © 2025
- Added "Made by Omar Zoubir" with link to GitHub profile
**Status:** Footer displays correctly with proper link

### 4. **Additional Features Added** - BONUS ✓
